Tournament Import Test - Rallye Lustenau 2025 U8
===============================================
This script tests tournament import functionality for tournaments with BYE rounds.
Tournament with 11 players (odd number) - one player gets a bye each round.

Test case: Handling of bye rounds and missing game results
Tournament: https://s3.chess-results.com/tnr1117463.aspx (U8 - SCHÜLER - Rallye Lustenau 2025)

Special features tested:
- Odd number of players (11 players)
- Bye rounds (one player sits out each round)
- Missing game data handling
- Tournament with international players (LTU, SUI players)
