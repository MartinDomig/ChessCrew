Tournament Import Test - 9. Int. Bodenseeopen 2025
=================================================
This script tests tournament import functionality for large international tournaments.
Tournament with 119 players from multiple countries - stress test for the import system.

Test case: Large-scale tournament import with international players and titles
Tournament: https://s3.chess-results.com/tnr1057011.aspx (9. Int. Bodenseeopen 2025)

Special features tested:
- Large number of players (119 participants)
- International participants from ~15 countries
- Player titles (GM, IM, FM, WCM, MK, CM)
- Complex rating systems (FIDE + national ratings)
- Potential bye-draws ("bye-Remis" until round 5)
- High-level tournament stress testing
